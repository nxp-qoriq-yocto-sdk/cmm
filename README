Conntrack Monitor Module For Fast Forward. It monitors the Linux connection table 
and adds or removes connections from the Forward Engine connection table.

CMM is split in several threads. Each thread is responsible for capturing one type 
of event. One thread captures the events happening on Linux connection tracking 
system. A second thread captures the events happening on Forward Engine (FE), 
and the third thread manages the Command Line Interface (CLI).
